- Star wars Memory
-   As the user I want to be able to click on a card and have it flip up
-   After two cards have flipped up. I want to be able to compare them
-   If the two flipped cards do not match, I want them to flip back down.
-   Once I'm able to flip all the cards I want the timmer to stop 
-   I made it so you can't click on the same card twice
-   this is a branch test
- reset button
